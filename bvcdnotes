Starts at CChoreoScene::SaveBinary
	Calls CChoreoScene::SaveToBinaryBuffer with an integer and iChoreoStringPool
		Writes SCENE_BINARY_TAG
		Writes SCENE_BINARY_VERSION
		Writes nTextVersionCRC
		Create array of events (eventList)
		//Get events without actors
		Iterates over m_Events
			Check to see if it doesn't have an actor.
			Append the event to the tail.
		Get a list of the count, assert it's below 255.
		Write the count to the buffer
		Iterate over eventList, call CChoreoEvent::SaveToBuffer
			Write as char GetType() (CChoreoEvent::EVENTTYPE)
			Write as short
